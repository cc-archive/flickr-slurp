Installation
============

All Machines

Install mysql.connector:

    sudo apt-get install python-mysql.connector


Database Server
---------------

Create a database on the database server.

Make it accessible from other machines.

Configure setup.yaml to connect to it.

Run setup-db.py to create the tables in the database and populate the shards
table.

    python setup-db.py

Make sure the shards table is populated properly.

Worker Clients
--------------

Configure config.yaml with the connection details for the database.

Create a flickr API key and enter its key and secret in config.yaml. See:

https://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html

Run the worker e.g. in a screen session.

    screen
    python ./worker.py

Watch the logs to see that the worker is connecting to the database and running
tasks, then disconnect from the screen session.
